### Why This Matters

Near-Earth Objects pose one of the few existential threats that humanity can actually predict 
and prevent with sufficient warning. This project demonstrates that:

- **Machine learning can automate asteroid screening** at scale
- **Early detection provides years of preparation time** for deflection missions
- **Accurate classification prevents both false alarms and missed threats**
- **Data-driven insights guide resource allocation** for monitoring efforts

By accelerating NEO detection and characterization, this project contributes to one of 
humanity's most important challenges: **protecting Earth from asteroid impacts**.

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Deploy best-performing models (Random Forest/Gradient Boosting)
2. **Short-term:** Integrate with real-time NEO tracking systems
3. **Long-term:** Scale to global early warning network with international cooperation
